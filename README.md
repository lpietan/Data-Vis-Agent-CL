# Data Visualization Agent

# Description
A command line implementation of an AI agent that produces data visualizations and/or data transformations from user dataset and user natural language prompt input. 

The AI agent is called from the command line and users can input a description of a figure (e.g. a plot, chart, graph) or data transformation that they want to be produced from a dataset of their choosing. The path and dataset file are then inputted. The agent generates and executes the python code to construct the figure or the updated transformed dataset file. 

The goal of building this command line data visualization agent was to develop a proof of concept prototype for future devlopment into a production ready tool for users with little to no programming abilities to use. This command line agent also serves as a building block for the development of other agents for mutiple use cases. 

# Usage
